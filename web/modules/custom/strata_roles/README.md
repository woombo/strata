## Installation

1. Enable the module: `drush en strata_roles`
2. All roles and permissions are automatically created
3. Assign users to appropriate roles via Admin â†’ People

## Role Hierarchy

The module enforces a single primary strata role per user:
1. Admin (highest priority)
2. Manager
3. Council Member  
4. Staff
5. Resident (lowest priority)

If a user is assigned multiple strata roles, only the highest priority role is retained.

## Usage

```php
// Check if user has any strata role
if (strata_roles_user_has_strata_role($user)) {
  // User has a strata role
}

// Get user's primary strata role
$role = strata_roles_get_primary_role($user);
if ($role) {
  $role_id = $role['id'];
  $role_label = $role['label'];
}
```

## Uninstalling

When the module is uninstalled, all strata-specific roles are automatically removed.
